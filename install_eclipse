If you've downloaded Eclipse from their official website, follow these steps for the installation.

    1. Extract the eclipse.XX.YY.tar.gz using

    tar -zxvf eclipse.XX.YY.tar.gz

    2. Become root and Copy the extracted folder to /opt

    sudo mv eclipse.XX.YY /opt

    3. Create a desktop file and install it:

    gedit eclipse.desktop

    and copy the following to the eclipse.desktop file.

    [Desktop Entry]
    Name=Eclipse 
    Type=Application
    Exec=env UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 eclipse44
    Terminal=false
    Icon=eclipse
    Comment=Integrated Development Environment
    NoDisplay=false
    Categories=Development;IDE;
    Name[en]=Eclipse

    then execute the following command to automatically install it in the unity:

    sudo desktop-file-install eclipse.desktop

    4. Create a symlink in /usr/local/bin using

    sudo ln -s /opt/eclipse/eclipse /usr/local/bin/eclipse44

    5. For eclipse icon to be displayed in dash, eclipse icon can be added as

    sudo cp /opt/eclipse/icon.xpm /usr/share/pixmaps/eclipse.xpm

    6. Give eclipse the required permissions to modify the osgi file.

    sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /opt/eclipse/configuration/org.eclipse.osgi

    7. Don't forget that you need to have either OpenJDK or Sun Java installed to be able to run eclipse. Check this question for more information about Java installation. Here is a simple example of installing Open JDK 1.6:

    sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk

That's it.
